Specifically, the page describes the following keyboard control functions: write(), press(), keyDown(), and keyUp(). It also provides information on the available keyboard keys, how to use the library functions to simulate key presses, and includes code examples for each function. Additionally, there are links to documentation for other PyAutoGUI functions and a cheat sheet for installation.",

The messages seem to cover different topics, including document analysis, optogenetics, Git file tracking, and the conversion of integer values to strings. There are also options for creating new chats, accessing settings, logging out, and sending messages.",

    "The chat suggests to use the `str()` function to convert an integer into a string, and then store the converted value in a variable. To concatenate an integer and a string without getting a `TypeError`, the integer first needs to be converted into a string using the `str()` function."
