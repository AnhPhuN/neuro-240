Keyboard Control Functions

The write() Function

The primary keyboard function is write() . This function will type the characters in the string that
is passed. To add a delay interval in between pressing each character key, pass an int or float for the
interval keyword argument.

For example:

>>> pyautogui.write('Hello world!') # prints out "Hello world!" instantly
>>> pyautogui.write('Hello world!', interval=0.25) # prints out "Hello world!" with a quarter

You can only press single-character keys with write() , So you can’t press the Shift or F1 keys, for
example.

The press(), keyDown(), and keyUp() Functions

To press these keys, call the press() function and pass it a string from the
pyautogui.KEYBOARD_KEYS suchas enter, esc, f1.See KEYBOARD_KEYS.

For example:

>>> pyautogui.press('enter') # press the Enter key
>>> pyautogui.press('f1') # press the F1 key
>>> pyautogui.press('left') # press the left arrow key

The press() function is really just a wrapper for the keyDown() and keyUp() functions, which
simulate pressing a key down and then releasing it up. These functions can be called by themselves.
For example, to press the left arrow key three times while holding down the Shift key, call the
following:
