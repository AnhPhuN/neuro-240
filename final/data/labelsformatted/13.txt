She later raised $4 million from venture capitalists for 20% of the company. After the financing, how much of the company does Jane own? How much do the angels and VCs? What if the VCs had bought 10% of the company for their $4 million? 40%?"

Rather than setting a price, the angels structure the investment as a loan, that will convert into equity when he raised venture financing at a price that is 20% below whatever the VCs pay per share. He later raised $4 million from venture capitalists for 20% of the company. After the financing, how much of the company does John own? How much do the angels and VCs?

Rather than setting a price, the angels structure the investment as a loan, that will convert into equity when he raised venture financing at a price that is 20% below whatever the VCs pay per share. Moreover, the angels insist on a "valuation cap": they will never pay more than $15/share for their shares. He later raises $4 million from venture capitalists for 20% of the company. After the financing, how much of the company does Josh own? How much do the angels and VCs? What if the VCs had bought 10% of the company for their $4 million? 40%?"
